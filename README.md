为了过六级请了两个星期假用来复习，接下来是为期两周的英语日记

## 2019/12/2

In order to pass College English Test 6, I ask my tutor Bro Kun that I want to take a half month off from the company, but he refsused. The reason I take off for so long is that a friend told me he did it before, but he didn't say what reason he used. Fortunately, Bro Kun is willing to give me two weeks' vacation in the end. So, my day off begins.

I go to have fun with my Friends on the weekend. So today, which is Monday, is the first day I start to review. Lazy me, turned off the alarm clock and continued to sleep, even after getting up I was watching the Samurai Champloo, and doing some unimportant things. The first day is over soon, but I sill can comfort myself that this is only the first day, that's alright, everything is okay.

Today is Tuesday. But actually, the English diary was wriiten since Thursday, so, what the hell just happened these days, 

👴 forgot. PS: the Samurai Champloo is a good work of art.

Get up at the same time with Bro Ji and Bro Geng, then I start my another boring day. OK, here we go, today is Wednesday, I finally got my exercise books that I bought several days aga on Taobao, and write a few words in the book, by the way, I finshed watching the Samurai Champloo.

## 2019/12/5

Thursday has came, maybe I would stay here just only one more day. Today, I spent an afternoon writing these diaries, besides, I finally understand the meaning of the word 'Champloo', it is a kind of Japanese cuisine which mixes vegetables with tofu.

It's finally the last day, Friday. Bro Geng told me to buy some food in the afternoon and cook tonight. Even though I hate trouble, I did it. After dinner, Bro Ji and I go to massage, then came home, ganged up with Bro Jun, and finally I took a shower, packed up and slept.

Asked two brothers to take my suitcase back to school in the morning, so that I don't have to bring it along with me all day, appreciate. Then I went to the graduation ceremony of my classmates, and we took many funny pictures together, it was a good time. 5 o'clock, I take the bus to go back to school, but there was a serious traffic jam in Guangzhou, after a long long ride, I finally got back to school.

🎅佛🌶

Said I would keep writing a diary every day, but I failed. These days I insisted on going to the library every day. I did it, really did it, but I didn't know how effective the review is, even I started to wonder if I was just touching myself. I realized that using more efficient learning methods was more important than diving into the library blindly.

So I decided to stay in the library only in the morning and review in the dormitory in the afternoon. I know I will be tempted by many things in my dormitory, but I wanna try some new methods, I hope that will bring me success.

What a stupid gambler 🙃

困扰了许久的问题终于解决辣

之前识别手写汉字 零 到 九， 总共10分类，特别顺利

后来增加到20分类就一直报错，一直不知道问题所在，今天把文件夹的名字改了之后解决了

之前命名是从0到19，但是系统读取文件时的顺序跟预期的不一样，现在改为字母从a到t，就ok了，cool

不知不觉我这第一份实习工作已经三个月了，想到这里的工作生活跟我大学生活一样已经过去，是永远回不去的

不禁感慨，但是不知道要感慨什么，不知道到底为何而感慨

没有觉得不舍，也没有想着赶紧离开，实习生对公司没有丝毫归属感，但每天工作压力不大真的很舒服？

这是好还是坏
