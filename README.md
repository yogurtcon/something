为了过六级请了两个星期假用来复习，接下来是为期两周的英语日记

## 2019/12/2

In order to pass College English Test 6, I ask my tutor Bro Kun that I want to take a half month off from the company, but he refsused. The reason I take off for so long is that a friend told me he did it before, but he didn't say what reason he used. Fortunately, Bro Kun is willing to give me two weeks' vacation in the end. So, my day off begins.

I go to have fun with my Friends on the weekend. So today, which is Monday, is the first day I start to review. Lazy me, turned off the alarm clock and continued to sleep, even after getting up I was watching the Samurai Champloo, and doing some unimportant things. The first day is over soon, but I sill can comfort myself that this is only the first day, that's alright, everything is okay.

Today is Tuesday. But actually, the English diary was wriiten since Thursday, so, what the hell just happened these days, 

👴 forgot. PS: the Samurai Champloo is a good work of art.

Get up at the same time with Bro Ji and Bro Geng, then I start my another boring day. OK, here we go, today is Wednesday, I finally got my exercise books that I bought several days aga on Taobao, and write a few words in the book, by the way, I finshed watching the Samurai Champloo.

## 2019/12/5

Thursday has came, maybe I would stay here just only one more day. Today, I spent an afternoon writing these diaries, besides, I finally understand the meaning of the word 'Champloo', it is a kind of Japanese cuisine which mixes vegetables with tofu.

It's finally the last day, Friday. Bro Geng told me to buy some food in the afternoon and cook tonight. Even though I hate trouble, I did it. After dinner, Bro Ji and I go to massage, then came home, ganged up with Bro Jun, and finally I took a shower, packed up and slept.

Asked two brothers to take my suitcase back to school in the morning, so that I don't have to bring it along with me all day, appreciate. Then I went to the graduation ceremony of my classmates, and we took many funny pictures together, it was a good time. 5 o'clock, I take the bus to go back to school, but there was a serious traffic jam in Guangzhou, after a long long ride, I finally got back to school.

Said I would keep writing a diary every day, but I failed. These days I insisted on going to the library every day. I did it, really did it, but I didn't know how effective the review is, even I started to wonder if I was just touching myself. I realized that using more efficient learning methods was more important than diving into the library blindly.

So I decided to stay in the library only in the morning and review in the dormitory in the afternoon. I know I will be tempted by many things in my dormitory, but I wanna try some new methods, I hope that will bring me success.

What a stupid gambler 🙃

困扰了许久的问题终于解决辣

之前识别手写汉字 零 到 九， 总共10分类，特别顺利

后来增加到20分类就一直报错，一直不知道问题所在，今天把文件夹的名字改了之后解决了

之前命名是从0到19，但是系统读取文件时的顺序跟预期的不一样，现在改为字母从a到t，就ok了，cool

不知不觉我这第一份实习工作已经三个月了，想到这里的工作生活跟我大学生活一样已经过去，是永远回不去的

不禁感慨，但是不知道要感慨什么，不知道到底为何而感慨

没有觉得不舍，也没有想着赶紧离开，实习生对公司没有丝毫归属感，但每天工作压力不大真的很舒服？

这是好还是坏

距离上次更新GitHub也即是做咸鱼已经一个月了，总算是登上了这个网站，改了这个库的主题样式，来记多一篇日记，其实这一个月里边有好几天都有写东西的想法了无奈真的太懒，就一直看手机玩游戏，咸鱼一条，下面言归正传

“不想结婚也不想生孩子”这个念头在我脑中盘踞了一段时间了，说长不长说短不短，到现在也跟几个人说过了，而且，他们都表示不理解，是的我也不知道自己是怎么有这个想法的，我也说过这可能是因为我现在年轻不懂事才会有这种想法，再过几年可能就变了，但其实我现在越来越觉得我可能不会变，因为这样做太有道理了，在这个世界上，什么都缺就是不缺人，我一直感叹人太多了，我觉得大多数的人存在于这个社会真的就只是在充数，贫困的人在受苦，不知道继续挣扎下去哪天才有出头之日，那如果他们出生之前知道自己是这样的命运并且有机会选择自己是否出生的话，他们会如何选择呢，我不知道，也许不是所有贫困人口都觉得难受，或许有的能活得开心，我不知道，我只能通过自己眼睛耳朵感受到一部分，再者就是数量最多最多的所谓的普通人，用理性的角度看世界，我的存在有意义吗没有，人类的存在有意义吗没有，地球的存在世界的存在好像都没有意义，普通人，为了养活家庭，必须上班，赚钱，有了子女，就需要更多钱，需要花更多时间上班，赚钱，然后娱乐时间变少，不开心的情绪累积，爆发，影响家庭，影响子女，普通家庭的子女接受着普通家庭的教育，进行着普通家庭的花销，抱着美好的期待未来成为这个社会上又一个普通人，肩负普通人的负担付出着普通人的劳动力，或许，有某个幸运儿，能够发光发亮，但我觉得几率太小，由于我现在没有信心能给子女我理想中所谓好的教育，无论是学校方面或者是家庭方面，所以，不想生孩子，以上是其中一方面原因。
